# GDLib [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/gdlib.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/gdlib)
A typesafe, rust library to interface with GD savefiles. It is intended to enable programmatic savefile operations, such as automatic level creation.

Documentation can be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/gdlib/latest/gdlib/).  
As of v0.3.1, GDLib is in active development.

## Repository structure
- `.github`: workflows for GitHub.
- `test_gmds`: .gmd files for tests.
- `src`: source code of library
- `examples`: example usages of GDLib.

## Overview
GDLib is an API that is designed to parse the Geometry Dash savefile format. It can parse levels and objects from the savefile (CCLocalLevels.dat) and from .gmd files. 

Features
* Full CRUD control: ability to create and modify levels at the developer's discretion
* Easy modification of objects through built-in methods and objects
* Full support for read from and writing to .dat and .gmd files
* Optimized to be fast and lightweight

## Usage instructions
This crate can be added to a project by running `cargo add gdlib`.

## Minimal example
This example can be found at `examples/minimal.rs`.
```rust
use gdlib::{core::GDError, gdlevel::Level, gdobj::Group};

fn main() -> Result<(), GDError> {
    // Load level from .gmd file
    let mut level = Level::from_gmd("test_gmds/level.gmd")?;

    // Get level data, which is None only if it hasn't been initialized.
    if let Some(data) = level.get_decrypted_data_ref() {
        // Add group 42 to all objects
        for obj in data.objects.iter_mut() {
            obj.config.add_group(Group::Regular(42));
        }
    }

    // Export level
    level.export_to_gmd("test_gmds/generated_group_42.gmd")?;
    Ok(())
}
```
